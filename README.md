Try our ACM Hour of code here! Here’s a list of instructions for your D’day!

Please ensure you have access to a laptop, a good internet connection, and perhaps a notebook/whiteboard in case you would like to figure something out.

Teamwork is good too. Please ensure you give credit to everyone. Don’t copy, paste code though. You can, however, use any frameworks/languages or libraries you want.

A GitHub/gitlab account for that is how you’ll probably submit your answers. If you don’t like either of these, you could consider using https://www.jovian.ml/ to share your jupyter notebooks. Sharing colab notebooks etc is fine too. Please comment out your code or even better write down your algorithm or approach at the top of your file so we know what is going on. FAILING TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN ENDING UP AT THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE LEADERBOARD possibly!

You'll be given access to three questions where the difficulty level gradually increases! So, suit yourself accordingly.

Thanks to Tony Holdroyd, Daniel J Broz, and Kevin Garda for their help and support. Special thanks to Prudhvi Raj!
