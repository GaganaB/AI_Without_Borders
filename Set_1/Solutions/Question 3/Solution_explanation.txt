In this problem, we are given a patch of an object and an image
with an object, and the objective is to use the patch to find the location of the image. 

Here I am using a version of the Sobel-Feldman filter (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator).

The process I used is as follows.

1. Apply the Scharr or any edge filter of your choice on the target image. This should give you all the edges.
2. To clear the noise out a bit, use a threshold and change anything less than that value to 0.
3. Once you have this image, use the given object as a filter and apply convolution on the thresholded image.
4. Do the thresholding again to make things more cleaner and purer so that it makes the next step easy.
5. Find the spot where the intensity is high and take that position.
6. That position +/- your filter size should give you the approximate location of the object.
7. Return the normalized coordinates of that position and if it the sum of absolute distance between the ground truth and 
your predicted position is <0.05, you did good. If not, you still did good. Cheer up.
8. (Optional & Not in Code because I was lazy) - Use the positions to draw a box around the object to show off to your friends.
You gotta brag about something. 

images.txt in Testing_Images has the ground truth coordinates.
