This question is called Separate But I Already Know because the main challenge is to cluster things....conditionally.

You are given a set of 102 images (51 male and 51 female) and your goal is cluster them into, you know, male and female.

The approach in the baseline is fairly simple.
  1. Flatten the images 
  2. Apply a clustering algorithm (agglomerative clustering in this case)
  3. Check score.
